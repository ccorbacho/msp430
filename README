MSP430 assembly interpreter in Scala

This is an attempt to implement an MSP430 assembly interpreter in Scala.

My final year university project was to implement an MSP430 emulator. It
didn't work out very well, so on and off since 2007, I've toyed with
re-implementing it from scratch; though it's more of an excuse to try out
new languages (in this case, Scala).

This may not get very far, so you probably shouldn't rely on it.

(For the curious - the MSP430 is a 16-bit microprocessor from Texas
Instruments, which at an assembly level is surprisingly similar to the
venerable PDP-11 of Unix fame).
